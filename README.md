The provided code snippet accomplishes a key task in financial data analysis: it retrieves and visualizes historical stock data. Specifically, it focuses on a stock listed on the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) with the ticker symbol `'RELIANCE.NS'`. Here's a comprehensive explanation of the overall role and functionality of the code:

Purpose and Key Functions

1. Fetch Historical Stock Data:
   - Function Used: `download_historical_data`
   - Library: `yfinance`
   - Description: The code uses the `yfinance` library to download historical stock data for a specified period. This data includes important metrics like opening price, closing price, high, low, and trading volume. The `download_historical_data` function streamlines this process by encapsulating the logic for data retrieval.

2. Visualize Stock Data:
   - Function Used: `plot_stock_data`
   - Library: `matplotlib`
   - Description: After fetching the data, the code uses the `matplotlib` library to create a time-series plot of the stock's closing prices. This visualization helps users understand the stock's performance trends over the specified period.

Detailed Breakdown

1. Setting Up Parameters:
   - The code starts by defining the stock symbol, start date, and end date for data retrieval. The `symbol` is set to `'RELIANCE.NS'`, which represents Reliance Industries on the NSE.
   - The `start_date` is a fixed date, `'2024-06-01'`, and `end_date` is dynamically set to the current date using `datetime.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')`.

2. Data Retrieval:
   - The `download_historical_data` function is called with the specified parameters. This function internally uses `yfinance` to query Yahoo Finance and fetch the stock data within the specified date range. 
   - The fetched data is stored in a Pandas DataFrame, making it easy to manipulate and analyze.

3. Data Inspection:
   - The code prints the first few rows of the DataFrame using `data.head()`. This allows a quick inspection of the data structure and the initial values, helping ensure the data has been retrieved correctly.

4. Data Visualization:
   - The `plot_stock_data` function is called to generate a plot of the stock's closing prices over time. 
   - The plot provides a visual representation of how the stock price has fluctuated, offering insights into trends, volatility, and potential areas of interest for further analysis.
